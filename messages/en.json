      "I have been programming for almost two years. In 2023 I heard about Python and, for a few days, I played around in the IDE. I was interested in the web, so I started with the basics and discovered JS.",

In 2024, I also collaborated with a group of friends (engineers, designers, copywriters), experimenting with technologies, learning, contributing and confronting myself. Currently I'm looking to land my first job as a web dev at a company.",
