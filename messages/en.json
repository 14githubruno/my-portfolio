      "I have been programming for almost two years. In 2023 I heard about Python and, for a few days, I played around in the IDE. I was interested in the web and wanted a radical change: so I started with the basics and discovered JS.",
      "In order to study, I took a break from work and started to develop some personal projects. In 2024, with a group of friends (engineers, designers, copywriters), I collaborated on a few products, experimenting with technologies, learning, contributing and confronting myself. P.S. Currently I'm looking to land my first job as a web developer (at a company).",
